# Shopping list

- The purpose of this code is to generate a shopping list using a `while` loop;
- In order to do so, we need to create an array containing all the items the user needs to buy;
- Then, we can create an index variable to use as a condition for our loop;
- IF the condition is true (`index < shoppingList.length`), the loop can go on;
- The purpose of the loop is to generate the HTML code required to make the shopping list visible for the user.
